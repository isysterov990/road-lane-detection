# Road Lane Detection

A road lane detection algorithm using the Canny Edge Detector and Hough Transforms

## Abstract

The use of technology in modern vehicles, such as cameras and smart ECUs, has led to advancements in assisted and autonomous driving. One of the main obstacles in the development of autonomous vehicles is the accurate detection of roads and obstacles. Road lane detection algorithms, a type of computer vision technology, are used in autonomous vehicles to identify lanes on the road and track the vehicle's position within them. Previous research on lane detection has focused on methods such as geometrical modelling and convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we propose an approach to lane detection using a hybrid model that combines the Canny edge detector and Hough Transform to detect road lanes with real-time performance in mind. Our approach shows promising results in various challenging scenarios, such as complex road topologies and low lighting.
